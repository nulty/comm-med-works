      <h1>The Organisation </h1>
      <p>      Community  Mediation Works emerged as a practical response to conflict and anti-social  behaviour in the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown area. It sought an effective remedy to  violence and anti-social behaviour that plagued community life – that remedy  was mediation. This conviction arose from work done by the Mountwood-Fitzgerald  Park Welfare Rights Committee to develop initiatives that would empower local  people to create a more just environment for themselves, their families and  their community. The level of conflict in the community and the lack of  strategies to creatively transform that conflict, and thus harnessing its  energy towards rebuilding the community, was worthy of attention. </p>
      <p>The outcome  was Community Mediation Works - a process where an impartial facilitator  supports and works with persons and groups in conflict to creatively approach  and transform that conflict by developing their own communication and  negotiation abilities and learning how to respect and work with different or  opposing views. The organisation’s mission is to promote peace in communities  through facilitating the resolution of conflict and effecting transformative  change by empowering residents with the capacity to address and resolve  conflict.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Although  the core service we provide is mediation, we understand that violence and  conflict are complex concepts and we have spearheaded complimentary initiatives  that address systemic causes of violence. Some of this work includes</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reports  published and research conducted on causes and experiences of conflict in  working class communities</li>
  <li>Youth  work addressing anger management</li>
  <li>Education  on restorative justice</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
